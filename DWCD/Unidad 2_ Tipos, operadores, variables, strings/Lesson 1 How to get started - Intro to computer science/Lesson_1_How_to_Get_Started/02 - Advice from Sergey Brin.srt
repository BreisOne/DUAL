00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,549
Lets get started by asking Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google,

2
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:06,298
what the most important thing is in building a search engine.

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,680
So what's your take on how to build a search engine?

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,184
You have built one before, right?

5
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:12,857
Yes, I think the most important thing

6
00:00:12,857 --> 00:00:14,664
if you want to build a search engine, I think is to

7
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:18,715
have a really good, fun corpus to start with.

8
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:25,286
In our case we used the world wide web which at the time was significantly smaller than it is today.

9
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:27,519
It was also very new and exciting

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,000
there were all kinds of unexpected things there.
