1
00:00:00,708 --> 00:00:03,666
So we are going to have many quizzes throughout each unit.

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:07,610
The point of the quiz is to check that you understand what we have covered.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,357
Some of the quizzes will be fairly straightforward just to see if you followed what we said.

4
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:17,609
Other quizzes will be more challenging and require you to put together several ideas that we have covered.

5
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:25,041
These quizzes don't count towards your grades. You will be able to try them as many times as you want until you hopefully get the answer right.

6
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:30,577
It certainly will be valuable to try to get the answer right the first time. But they shouldn't be stressful.

7
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:33,987
They are meant to keep you engaged in the lecture and to make sure you are understanding things.

8
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:40,627
After each quiz there will be an explanation and answer that often will go in more depth than just answering the quiz correctly.

9
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:46,953
So for the first quiz and to get started practicing quizzes our question is what is the goal of Unit 1?

10
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:50,618
So there are 4 choices: You can check all the choices that you think are good answers.

11
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:54,283
The first choice is that the goal is to get started programming.

12
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:57,950
The second choice is to learn some important computer science concepts.

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:03,482
The third choice is to write some code that extracts a link from a webpage.

14
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:09,379
The fourth choice is to write code to rank web pages.

15
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:14,391
So that is first quiz. Check as many answers as you think are correct.
