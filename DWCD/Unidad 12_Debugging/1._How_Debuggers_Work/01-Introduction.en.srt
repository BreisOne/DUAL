Welcome to the first unit on how debuggers work.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this unit, I'm going to introduce you to the scientific method of debugging,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which is a process by which through a systematic experiment,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
you'll slowly get guided towards the cause of the problem.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're also going to see why talking to a teddy bear can be an effective method

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,000
of finding out what's going wrong, and in the end, we're going to build an interactive debugger--enjoy.
