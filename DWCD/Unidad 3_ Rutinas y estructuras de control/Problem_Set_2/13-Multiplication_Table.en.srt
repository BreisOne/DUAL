1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So here is an example.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If the input is the number 2 what you should print out is:

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I hope I got all those right without using the interpreter.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To be correct, you must print them out in the same order as we're showing here.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
There will be a longer example in the coments to make sure the order is clear.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
They should match exactly this format as well.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is a pretty hard question, so it's worth a gold star.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Actually, I'm going to make it worth two gold stars.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
As a hint, one of the things you need to think about to do this question

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
is something that we haven't seen before,

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but you've seen it for ifs.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We saw in the lecture to define biggest that we used one if inside another if.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 99:59:59,000
To solve this you're going to have to think about using a while inside another while.
